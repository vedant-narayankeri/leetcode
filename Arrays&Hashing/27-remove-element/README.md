# Problem 27: Remove element

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

## Examples

Example 1:
```text
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

## Core Concept
Essentially we iterate over `nums` array and also keep and `index` pointer (place where next valid element goes to override `nums` array)
We re-assign `nums[index]` whenever `nums[i] != val`, this means that we are doing inplace replacement for array
And from index -> 0 to index 
Need to return `index` value which is equal to number of elements that are not target val - that's what needs to be returned (elements of use left after so-called removal)

Idea -  "we can overwrite unwanted elements in place"

Intuition: (From Neetcode)
Instead of using extra space, we can overwrite unwanted elements in place.
We use a write pointer k that tracks where the next valid element should go.
As we scan through the array, whenever we find an element that is not equal to val, we write it at position k and move k forward.
At the end, everything before index k contains valid elements.
